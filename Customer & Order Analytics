---In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about Customer and Order Data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(Product) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE product = 'iPhone';


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT acctnum
FROM  BIT_DB."customers" customer
INNER JOIN BIT_DB."FebSales" feb
ON feb.orderID = customer.order_id;


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT MIN(price), product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(Quantity*price) AS Revenue  
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product;


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Quantity, location, SUM(Quantity*price) AS Revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location =  '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'; 


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(customer.acctnum), AVG(price * Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
Join  BIT_DB.customers customer
ON feb.orderID = customer.order_ID
WHERE feb.QuantiTy > 2;


#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT DISTINCT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;


#9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '%NY%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) > 2;


#10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY Product;


#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February?
SELECT SUM(Quantity*price)/COUNT(cus.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb 
JOIN BIT_DB.customers cus 
ON feb.orderID = cus.order_id;

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 
SELECT AVG(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers cus
ON feb.orderID = cus.order_id;

ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
